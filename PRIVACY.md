## Information Collection and Usage

The Google Main Page Chrome Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. It operates locally within your browser and does not interact with external servers.

## Usage of Permissions

All data processed by the extension stays within the user's browser and is not shared with any external services. The extension does not include any tracking mechanisms.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not utilize any third-party services, APIs, or external resources. All functionality is contained within the extension itself.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes in the extension's features or to comply with legal requirements. Users will be notified of any significant changes.
